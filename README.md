#What is this repo?

This repo contains my solution of assignment in 2015 Stanford Machine Learning Class.
Please read the "Stanford Honor Code" below.

## Stanford Honor Code

> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). 
We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that
you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss
them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look 
at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
